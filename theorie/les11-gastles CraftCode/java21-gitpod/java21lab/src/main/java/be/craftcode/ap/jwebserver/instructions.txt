First, make sure you're in the correct folder.

In vscode, right-click this folder (jwebserver) and click "Open In Integrated Terminal" (fourth option from the top).

Or, simply open a terminal and enter "cd java21lab/src/main/java/be/craftcode/ap/jwebserver" 
(copy the above command and shift + insert to paste in terminal).

To serve the page locally (accessible on your own machine),
once you're in the folder you want to serve, simply write the command "jwebserver" and hit enter. 
The index.html webpage will be available on your machine at http://localhost:8000 .

To serve the page publicly, if you're in vscode on gitpod, click "Make Public" when the box pops up.
Then click on the "PORTS" tab in the same box as the terminal. Copy the address next to Port 8000 and 
enter it in any internet connected device (your phone, another browser) to see the contents of index.html .

Hit CTRL-C in the terminal to stop the server.
